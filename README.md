# Lydia

Lightweight, fast and easy to use small ruby web framework.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'lydia'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install lydia

## Another ruby web framework? Wtf? Why?

This project is not intended to become a top notch framework or the new rails, it's just an experiment. 
The goals of this project are:

* [Rack](https://github.com/rack/rack/) based.
* Modular (Router, Application...).
* A powerful router that works stand alone too.
* Templates support.
* Well written, easy to read and to understand code.
* [Don't repeat yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
* Less lines of code as possible (but no [code golf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_golf)).
* [100% test code coverage](https://coveralls.io/github/MirkoMignini/lydia?branch=master).
* [0 coveralls issues](https://codeclimate.com/github/MirkoMignini/lydia/issues).
